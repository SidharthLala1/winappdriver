# WinAppDriver - WebDriver for Windows Applications

WinAppDriver is a GUI test automation library for use with Windows applications, and technically it is a [WebDriver implementation](https://github.com/imsardine/winappdriver/wiki/Protocol-Implementation) for Windows applications.

In the beginning, it supports only [store apps](https://github.com/imsardine/winappdriver/wiki/Store-Apps), and then the support for [traditional desktop application](https://github.com/imsardine/winappdriver/wiki/Desktop-Applications) is added. As the name suggests, it aims for being a single tool for test automation of all kinds of Windows applications, therefore the support for [CEF-based desktop applications](https://github.com/imsardine/winappdriver/wiki/CEF-Based-Applications) and [Windows Phone apps](https://github.com/imsardine/winappdriver/wiki/Phone-Apps) are planned as well.

**Give it a try! To get started, follow the instructions described in [Getting Started](https://github.com/imsardine/winappdriver/wiki/Getting-Started), and your [feedback](https://github.com/imsardine/winappdriver/issues) is highly appreciated.**

Hope that this tool will make our life more easier if you are asked to implement automated test against Windows applications.
